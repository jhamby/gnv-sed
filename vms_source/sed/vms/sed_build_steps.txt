From File: sed_build_steps.txt

Building SED on OpenVMS for use with GNV requires a current HP C compiler
and MMK.

The HP C 7.x compilers were used for building on Alpha and Itanium.
The Compaq C 6.4 compiler is being used on VAX.

MMK was obtained from https://github.com/endlesssoftware/mmk

Several special things were done in this port of Sed to VMS to make it
easier to keep it up to date with the Unix version.

Note the GNV$ prefix is registered for the GNV project to prevent name
collisions with other products and packages.  This is a VMS convention.

The files are stored with GNV_ instead of GNV$ most open source source
code maintainers do not want to files with $ in their source repositories.

The build procedure will copy the files to have the GNV$ names as needed.

1. The original GNU Sed source files are in their own directory tree which
is never written to by the build process.  This directory is kept up to date
with the current official patches.  See below about the how this is done
with logical names.

2. A file vms_eco_level.h is used to set the ECO of the package.  The
vms_eco_level.h needs to be set back to zero if the version or patch level
of the GNU Unix source is changed.  This file is currently only used
by the kit building procedure.

The source kits are provided in backup savesets inside of the PCSI install kit.

Backup save sets are currently the only distribution medium that I can be
sure is installed on a target VMS system that will correctly unpack files
with extended character sets in them.  You may need to adjust the ownership
of the restored files for kits on Alpha/Itanium VMS versions 8.1 and earlier.

On VAX, the filenames will be as seen on the VAX system, typically with non
ODS-2 characters and case changes prefixed with $ characters.

[gnv.common_src]sed_*_original_src.bck is the original source of the
sed kit as provided by the GNV project.
[gnv.vms_src]sed-*_vms_src.bck, if present, has the changed files that
are used for building that are not yet in the sed source kits
distributed by the GNU sed project.

These backup savesets should be restored to different directory trees on
an ODS-5 volume(s) which are referenced by concealed rooted logical names,
unless on VAX, where either an NFS or ODS-2 volume can be used.

SRC_ROOT: is for the source files common to all platforms.  This can be a
          read only copy of the files from a change control repository.

VMS_ROOT: is for the files that were changed from the repository copy of
          SRC_ROOT:

          Note, you should create the VMS_ROOT: directory tree even if it is
          initially empty.  This is where you should put edits if you are
          making changes.

          In my build environment, the source_root:[gnu_vms.sed] is a
          directory with the checked out code and vms_root:[sed] is
          a copy with any local modifications.

          The command procedure compare_sed_source.com will report any
          differences in the source_root:[gnu_vms.sed] directory and the
          vms_root:[sed] directory.  If the source_root: logical is not
          defined, it will translate the logical name src_root to do the
          effective of src_root:[sed.-.-.gnu_vms.sed] to find the
          VMS specific code CVS checkout based on where the checkout for
          the GNU source is expected to be.

LCL_ROOT: is manually created to have the same base and sub-directories as
          SRC_ROOT: and VMS_ROOT:  This is for the architecture specific
          binaries and other files created during the build.

The logical name REF_ROOT: is optionally defined to be a logical name that
is a search list for VMS_ROOT:,SRC_ROOT:

The logical name PRJ_ROOT: is defined to be a logical name that is a search
list for LCL_ROOT:,REF_ROOT:

The VMS_ROOT and LCL_ROOT directory trees can be created with commands
similar to:

  $ create/dir lcl_root:[sed]/prot=w:re
  $ copy src_root:[sed...]*.dir -
    lcl_root:[sed...]/prot=(o:rwed,w:re)
  $ create/dir vms_root:[sed]/prot=w:re
  $ copy src_root:[sed...]*.dir -
    vms_root:[sed...]/prot=(o:rwed,w:re)

One of the ways with to protect the source from being modified is to have
the directories under src_root: owned by a user or resource where the build
username only has read access to it.

Edit the file sed_release_note_start.txt or other text files to reflect
any changes.

Edit the file PCSI_SED_FILE_LIST.TXT if there are new files added to the
kit.  These files should all be ODS-2 legal filenames and directories.

Note that if src_root: or vms_root: are NFS mounted disks, the
step of backing up the source files will probably hang or fail.

You need to copy the source files to VMS mounted disks and create
logical names SRC_ROOT1 and VMS_ROOT1 to work around this to to
reference local disks.  Make sure src_root1:[000000] and
vms_root1:[000000] exist and can be written to.

The command procedure compare_sed_source can be used to check
those directories and keep them up to date.

    @[.vms]compare_sed_source.com SRCBCK UPDATE

    This compares the reference GNU source with the backup
    staging directory for it and updates with any changes.

    @[.vms]compare_sed_source.com VMSBCK UPDATE

    This compares the VMS specific source with the backup
    staging directory for it and updates with any changes.

    Leave off "UPDATE" to just check without doing any changes.

    If you are not using NFS mounted disks and do not want to have a
    separate directory for staging the sources for backup make sure
    that src_root1: and vms_root1: do not exist.

The kits will be built in the directory STAGE_ROOT:[KIT], which must be
writable to the build procedure.

Define the logical name GNV_PCSI_PRODUCER to indicate who is making the
distribution.

Define the logical name GNV_PCSI_PRODUCER_FULL_NAME to be your full name
or full name of your company.

These two GNV_PCSI_* logical names need to be manually defined to indicate
the "branding" to differentiate the source of the kit.

A limitation of the PCSI kitting procedure is that when selecting files, it
tends to ignore the directory structure and assumes that all files with the
same name are the same file, so every file placed in the kit must have a
unique ODS-2 legal name.  Then a procedure needs to be added to the kit to
create an alias link on install and remove the link on remove.

While newer versions of PCSI can support ODS-5 filenames, not all verions
of PCSI on systems that have ODS-5 filenames do.  So as a post install step,
the PCSI kit built by these steps does a rename to the correct case.

While the kit building procedure tries to detect beta or test kit builds,
by passing the P1 parameter as "BETA" it will force the kit to use "B" for
the version prefix letter.  If the P2 parameter is also specified, the first
letter of it will be used for the version prefix letter.

With these search lists set up and the logical names described, Sed can
be built and kitted by setting your default to PRJ_ROOT:[sed]
and then issuing the command:

   $ @[.vms]pcsi_product_sed.com

First it will build the binaries by using  MMK utility.  The case of the
parameter may be significant on ODS-5.

   $ mmk/descrip=[.vms]sed.mms

This sed.mms script also builds debug image and experimental images that
use record mode reads instead of the default character reads.  Examine the
source for more details.  These extra images are not added to the resulting
PCSI kit.

To clean up after a build to start over, run mmk with the target realclean.

   $ mmk/descrip=[.vms]sed.mms realclean

The files are installed into a NEW_GNU directory for staging by running the
procedure stage_sed_install.com.  This copies the binaries and creates
alias links to them.

   $ @[.vms]stage_sed_install.com remove
   $ @[.vms]stage_sed_install.com

On the VAX platform, the staged files are needed for building the PCSI
kit, as the VAX source was staged on an NFS volume, which encodes the
filenames that have any upper case or special symbols in them.

To remove the staged files, the procedure is run again with the parameter
"REMOVE".  This makes sure that the alias links are removed.

The names and contents of the PCSI files requires that the version of
sed be encoded in a special format.  This is done by:

   @[.vms]make_pcsi_sed_kit_name.com

The release notes are built from the release note start, readme files and
this file:

   @[.release]build_sed_release_notes.com

Then the backup the source kits.

Building a PCSI kit for an architecture takes the following steps after
making sure that you have a working build environment.

On VAX, the product command always prompts to the terminal for a confirmation.

If there is another kit for this same version of sed, but for a different
base platform or operating system version, the product command will prompt
to the terminal to select which one to compress.

       The following message is normal:
          %PCSI-I-CANNOTVAL, cannot validate
            EAGLE$DQA0:[stage_root.][kit]GNV-AXPVMS-SED-V--1.PCSI;1
          -PCSI-I-NOTSIGNED, product kit is not signed and therefore has
          no manifest file

This will result in an uncompressed kits for the target platform by
default.

To run the self tests on the built image:

   $ set default [.testsuite]
   $ @[-.vms]sed_testsuite.com

Good Luck.
